> An interpreter for Typescript that can evaluate an arbitrary Node within a Typescript AST

## Description

This library is an implementation of an interpreter for Typescript that can evaluate any `Expression`, `ExpressionStatement` or `Declaration` within a Typescript AST.
Rather than interpreting a _program_, or a sequence of `Statement`s, this library takes a Node within an existing AST and evaluates it based on its' lexical environment.

This makes the library an effective companion if you're building a linter, framework, language service, partial evaluator, or something else where you may want to know the
computed value of a specific Node at any point in an AST.

To that end, several _policy_ options can be provided to configure restrictions in terms of what is allowed to be evaluated, such as IO and Network access.
Additionally, `ts-evaluator` supports both a Browser environment, a Node environment, and a pure ECMAScript environment. See [Setting up an environment](#setting-up-an-environment) for more details.

If you are looking for a Typescript REPL, or a way to _execute_ a full Typescript program, you're looking for something like [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) instead.

## Install

### NPM

```
$ npm install @wessberg/ts-evaluator
```

### Yarn

```
$ yarn add @wessberg/ts-evaluator
```

## Usage

Let's start off with a very basic example:

```typescript
import {evaluate} from "@wessberg/ts-evaluator";

const result = evaluate({
	node: someNode,
	typeChecker: someTypeChecker
});

// If a value was produced
if (result.success) {
	console.log(result.value);
}

// If an error occurred
else {
	console.log(result.reason);
}
```

In this example, the referenced bindings within the lexical environment of the Node will be discovered and evaluated before producing a final value. This means that
you don't have to evaluate the entire program to produce a value which may potentially be a much faster operation.

### Setting up an environment

You can define the kind of environment that `evaluate()` assumes when evaluating the given Node. By default, a `Node` environment is assumed.

The following environment presets are supported:

- `ECMA`
	-	Assumes a pure ECMAScript environment. This means that no other globals than those that are defined in the ECMAScript spec such as `Math`, `Promise`, `Object`, etc, are available.
- `NODE`
	- Assumes a Node environment. This means that built-in modules such as `fs` and `path` can be resolved, and Node-specific globals such as `process` is present.
- `BROWSER`
	- Assumes a Browser environment. This means that DOM APIs are available and Browser-specific globals such as `window` is present.
